Interactive Sequential Planner - Two-phase planning workflow

PLANNING PHASE: Step-based planning with forced reflection pauses.
REVIEW PHASE: Orchestrates TW annotation and QR validation before execution.

Usage:
    # Planning phase (default)
    python3 planner.py --step-number 1 --total-steps 4 --thoughts "Design auth system"

    # Review phase (after plan is written)
    python3 planner.py --phase review --step-number 1 --total-steps 2 --thoughts "Plan written to plans/auth.md"
